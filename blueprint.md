# Lotto Number Generator

## Overview

This project is a simple web application that generates and displays random lottery numbers. It's built using modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging web components for a modular structure.

## Design and Features

*   **Responsive Design:** The layout will adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring a good experience on both mobile and desktop.
*   **Modern Aesthetics:** The UI will feature a clean and visually appealing design with a modern color palette, typography, and subtle animations.
*   **Web Component:** The generated lottery numbers will be displayed using a custom web component (`lotto-ball`) to encapsulate the styling and behavior of each number.
*   **Interactive Elements:** A "Generate Numbers" button will trigger the lottery number generation with a smooth animation.

## Current Plan

1.  **Create `blueprint.md`:** Document the project plan.
2.  **Update `index.html`:** Set up the basic structure of the application, including a title, header, a container for the lottery numbers, and a generation button.
3.  **Update `style.css`:** Apply modern styling to the application, including a responsive layout, custom fonts, a vibrant color scheme, and styles for the lottery number balls and button.
4.  **Update `main.js`:**
    *   Implement the logic for generating unique random lottery numbers.
    *   Create a `LottoBall` web component to display each number.
    *   Add an event listener to the "Generate Numbers" button to trigger the number generation and display.
